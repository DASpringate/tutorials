### Abstract

> Primary care databases (PCDs), such as GPRD, THIN and QRESEARCH, contain detailed information on GP consultations for millions of patients. PCDs are increasingly used to investigate topics of importance in primary care and offer a means to investigate research questions which cannot be addressed by other means. 

> We focus on uses of PCDs for primary care research. We used text-mining techniques to extract information about the uses of primary care databases (PCDs) from the abstracts and article metadata of all studies reported by the three main UK PCDs. Publications using UK PCDs are increasing at an exponential rate and are attracting global research interest.  Types of study and analysis methods are changing over time, with more complex and robust methods becoming more popular as the field develops.

> The quality of a PCD study is dependent on (among other things) the validity of the clinical codes (such as Read codes) used to define the population of interest and their disease conditions.  There is currently no obligation to publish clinical code lists, making it impossible to fully validate or replicate previous studies. We are developing an online repository where researchers can deposit their clinical code lists, as well as download code lists from previous studies.  The ability to build on existing code lists when developing new lists will ease a considerable bottleneck in database research, reducing the need to “reinvent of the wheel” each time a new PCD study is undertaken.
