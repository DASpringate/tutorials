Outline
-------

1. Use of text-mining to explore the scientific literature
2. Text-mining the PCD literature
    - What is being studied using PCD's?
    - Changes in topics of investigation over time
3. Validity of Clinical coding

Text mining 
===========

What is it?
-----------

> * The process of extracting high-quality structured information from unstructured text (e.g. Scientific literature).
> * Uses a variety of computational and statistical methods to find patterns and trends in text

### Text mining consists of:

1. Information extraction
    - Automatically extracting structured information from unstructured text
2. Semantic searching 
    - Improves search accuracy by including context into a search
3. Knowledge discovery
    - Identifying relationships in extracted data

Why do we need it?

Text mining the PCD literature
==============================

UK Primary Care Databases
-------------------------

### GPRD / CPRD

The General Practice Research Database / The Clinical Practice Research Datalink

> * ~ 900 papers

### THIN 

The Health Improvement Network

> * ~ 360 papers

### QResearch

> * ~ 75 papers

The Dataset
-----------

* All articles reported by CPRD, THIN, QResearch in Pubmed
* 1185 Abstracts with metadata
* 141 full-text articles for validation

###### How are PCD's being used by researchers?


PCD studies are a growth area!
------------------------------

Number of publications is rapidly increasing...

PCD studies are a growth area!
------------------------------

... and there is global interest in UK PCD research

Study types are changing...

...as are analysis methods

PCD validity
============

* PCDs have many advantages for informing medical practice:
    - study size
    - incorporating comorbidities
    - Socio-economic covariates
* Studies have shown that PCDs often give results concordant with RCTs (Tannen's group @ Uni. Penn.)

Threats to validity
-------------------

* Unmeasured confounding
* Correlation does not equal causation
* GP recording
* Clinical coding

Clinical Coding in PCD's
------------------------

> * All clinical events are entered by GP's as clinical codes:

\pause

>    - Symptoms, signs & diagnoses (READ codes)
>    - Referrals to external care centres
>    - Immunisation records
>    - Prescription information
>    - Diagnostic test records and results

\pause

> * Everything recorded by a GP can be identified (if you know which codes to look for and where to look for them!)

\pause

### e.g.

> * H331.00 - Asthma diagnosis
> * H33z011 - Severe asthma attack
> * 33G1    - Spirometry testing

Clinical codes in PCD studies
-----------------------------

Diagnoses are made by reference to a set of clinical codes

### Workflow

> 1. Researchers decide on a rough set of codes for a condition
>     - By searching lookup tables for matching terms
>     - By reference to an external source (e.g. QOF)
> 2. Clinicians go through this draft list by hand and select the relevant codes
> 3. The database is searched for events matching the finalised code list
> 4. The correct combination of events in the timeframe of interest gives a diagnosis
>     - e.g. For Asthma: Need at least 1+ clinical event  1+ drug event in the last year to qualify
    
Code list? What code list?
--------------------------

> * Currently no obligation to publish code lists
> * No centralised repository for clinical codes
> * The vast majority of PCD studies do not publish their codes
> * No way of knowing if a condition diagnosis is valid    
> * No way to replicate the research

### For example...

In 45 UK case-control PCD studies (diabetes):

\pause

* Only 5 reported ANY clinical codes...
* Only 2 of these published codes in appendix
* Only 1 provided full set of code lists

Validity of Clinical coding
---------------------------

Clinical codes should be held to scrutiny and peer-review (either pre- or post-publication)

This would allow for:

* replication of studies
* validation of diagnoses
* incremental improvements to clinical definitions


ClinicalCodes.org
-----------------

...Is an online repository for PCD researchers to upload their codes upon publication.
